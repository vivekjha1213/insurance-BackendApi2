# insurance-BackendApi-SpringBoot-Hibernate-Jpa
Insurance-BackendApi is a backend RESTful API application built with the Spring Boot framework. The application provides endpoints for managing insurance claims, policies, and customers. The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete insurance claims, policies, and customers.

The application uses a MySQL database for persistent storage and Hibernate as the ORM tool. It also includes Swagger UI for API documentation and testing.

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, with the following packages:

Model: Contains the POJO classes for Claim, Customer, and Policy entities.
Repository: Contains the interfaces extending the Spring Data JPA repository to perform CRUD operations.
Service: Contains the business logic of the application.
Controller: Contains the RESTful API endpoints for handling HTTP requests.
Exception: Contains custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios.
Overall, the Insurance-BackendApi provides a reliable and scalable solution for managing insurance claims and policies with the use of modern technologies and best practices.
